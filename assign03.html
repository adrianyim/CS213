      <p class="para">What is League of Legens?  League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
The game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions, and was inspired by the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients. In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen 'summoner' that controls a 'champion' with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players. The goal is to destroy the opposing team 'nexus', a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. League of Legends was generally well received upon its release in 2009, and has since in popularity, with an active and expansive fanbase.</p>

I also play other strategy games, such as: Age of Empires (AOE), WarCraft III, StarCraft III, and Hearthstone. However, I do not like shooting and racing games, such as: Call of Duty and Halo. The following are my favorite champions that I use in the League of Legends: </p>

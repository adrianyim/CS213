                    <p>Professor Minerva McGonagall, was a half-blood witch, the only daughter of Muggle Robert McGonagall and witch Isobel Ross. She had two younger brothers Malcolm and Robert Jr. Minerva was a registered Animagus who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1947-1954 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House, but it took the sorting hat five minutes and a helf to decide if she was Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore making her a hatstall.</p>
                    <p>After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor and concurrently, at differing times, Deputy Headmistress and Headmistress of Hogwarts.</p>
                    <p>McGonagall was also a member of the Order of the Phoenix. In 1995, she opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrow from 1997 until 1998, and as part of this resistance movement, fought in several battles of both wars, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts, where she led the resistance against Lord Voldemort.</p>
                    <p>She survived the Second Wizarding War and continued her job as Headmistress, a title she still holds as of Albus Potter's time at Hogwarts.</p>
